NOTES:

    net2tsd - really early-stage development, exploring both Linux' lack of APIs and Rust

USAGE:

    net2tsd interface-name interval count

    This has only been compiled and tested on Fedora 40 x86_64, so running it on any other
    Linux distro, even a related one, may or may not work.
